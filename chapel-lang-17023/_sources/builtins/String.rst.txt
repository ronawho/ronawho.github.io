Strings
=======

The following documentation shows functions and methods used to
manipulate and process Chapel strings.

Methods Available in Other Modules
----------------------------------

Besides the functions below, some other modules provide routines that are
useful for working with strings. The :mod:`IO` module provides
`IO.string.format` which creates a string that is the result of
formatting. It also includes functions for reading and writing strings.
The :mod:`Regexp` module also provides some routines for searching
within strings.

Casts from String to a Numeric Type
-----------------------------------

The :mod:`string <String>` type supports casting to numeric types. Such casts
will convert the string to the numeric type and throw an error if the string is
invalid. For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

  var number = "a":int;

throws an error when it is executed, but

.. code-block:: chapel

  var number = "1":int;

stores the value ``1`` in ``number``.

To learn more about handling these errors, see the
:ref:`Error Handling technical note <readme-errorHandling>`.


Unicode Support
---------------

Chapel strings use the UTF-8 encoding. Note that ASCII strings are a simple
subset of UTF-8 strings, because every ASCII character is a UTF-8 character with
the same meaning.

UTF-8 strings might not work properly if a UTF-8 environment is not used. See
:ref:`character set environment <readme-chplenv.character_set>` for more
information.

.. _string.nonunicode:

Non-Unicode Data and Chapel Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For doing string operations on non-Unicode or arbitrary data, consider using
:mod:`bytes <Bytes>` instead of string. However, there may be cases where
:mod:`string <String>` must be used with non-Unicode data. Examples of this are
file system and path operations on systems where UTF-8 file names are not
enforced.


In such scenarios, non-UTF-8 data can be escaped and stored in a string in a way
that it can be restored when needed. For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

 var myBytes = b"Illegal \xff sequence";  // \xff is non UTF-8
 var myEscapedString = myBytes.decode(policy=decodePolicy.escape);

will escape the illegal `0xFF` byte and store it in the string. The escaping
strategy is similar to Python's "surrogate escapes" and is as follows.

 - Each individual byte in an illegal sequence is bitwise-or'ed with `0xDC00` to
   create a 2-byte codepoint.
 - Then, this codepoint is encoded in UTF-8 and stored in the string buffer.

This strategy typically results in storing 3 bytes for each byte in the illegal
sequence. Similarly escaped strings can also be created with
:proc:`createStringWithNewBuffer` using a C buffer.

An escaped data sequence can be reconstructed with :proc:`~string.encode`:

.. code-block:: chapel

 var reconstructedBytes = myEscapedString.encode(policy=encodePolicy.unescape);
 writeln(myBytes == reconstructedBytes);  // prints true

Alternatively, escaped sequence can be used as-is without reconstructing the
bytes:

.. code-block:: chapel

 var escapedBytes = myEscapedString.encode(policy=encodePolicy.pass);
 writeln(myBytes == escapedBytes);  // prints false

.. note::

  Strings that contain escaped sequences cannot be directly used with
  unformatted I/O functions such as ``writeln``. :ref:`Formatted I/O
  <about-io-formatted-io>` can be used to print such strings with binary
  formatters such as ``%|s``.

.. note::

  The standard :mod:`FileSystem`, :mod:`Path` and :mod:`IO` modules can use
  escaped strings as described above for paths and file names.


Lengths and Offsets in Unicode Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Unicode strings, and in particular UTF-8 strings, there are several possible
units for offsets or lengths:

 * bytes
 * codepoints
 * graphemes

Most methods on the Chapel string type currently work with codepoint units by
default. For example, :proc:`~string.size` returns the length in codepoints
and `int` values passed into :proc:`~string.this` are offsets in codepoint
units.

It is possible to indicate byte or codepoint units for indexing in the
string methods by using arguments of type ``byteIndex`` or
``codepointIndex`` respectively.

For speed of indexing with their result values, :proc:`~string.find()`
and :proc:`~string.rfind()` return a ``byteIndex``.

.. note::

  Support for grapheme units is not implemented at this time.

Using the ``byteIndex`` and ``codepointIndex`` types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A value of type ``byteIndex`` or ``codepointIndex`` can be passed to certain
``string`` functions to indicate that the function should operate with units of
bytes or codepoints. Passing a ``codepointIndex`` has the same behavior as
passing an integral type. See :proc:`~string.this` for an example.

Both of these types can be created from an ``int`` via assignment or cast. They
also support addition and subtraction with ``int``. Finally, values of same
types can be compared.

For example, the following function returns a string containing only the second
byte of the argument:

   .. code-block:: chapel

     proc getSecondByte(arg:string) {
       var offsetInBytes = 1:byteIndex;
       return arg[offsetInBytes];
     }

Whereas the following function returns a string containing only the second
codepoint of the argument:

   .. code-block:: chapel

     proc getSecondCodepoint(arg:string) {
       var offsetInCodepoints = 1:codepointIndex;
       return arg[offsetInCodepoints];
     }

             (i.e., the range ``0..<this.size``)
   

.. method:: proc string.numBytes

   
   :returns: The number of bytes in the string.
   

.. method:: proc string.numCodepoints

   
   :returns: The number of codepoints in the string, assuming the
             string is correctly-encoded UTF-8.
   

.. method:: proc string.localize(): string

   
   Gets a version of the :mod:`string <String>` that is on the currently
   executing locale.
   
   :returns: A shallow copy if the :mod:`string <String>` is already on the
             current locale, otherwise a deep copy is performed.
   

.. method:: proc string.c_str(): c_string

   
   Get a `c_string` from a :mod:`string <String>`.
   
   .. warning::
   
       This can only be called safely on a :mod:`string <String>` whose home is
       the current locale.  This property can be enforced by calling
       :proc:`string.localize()` before :proc:`~string.c_str()`. If the
       string is remote, the program will halt.
   
   For example:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
       var my_string = "Hello!";
       on different_locale {
         printf("%s", my_string.localize().c_str());
       }
   
   :returns:
       A `c_string` that points to the underlying buffer used by this
       :mod:`string <String>`. The returned `c_string` is only valid when used
       on the same locale as the string.
   

.. method:: proc string.encode(policy = encodePolicy.pass): bytes

   
   Returns a :mod:`bytes <Bytes>` from the given :mod:`string <String>`. If the
   string contains some escaped non-UTF8 bytes, `policy` argument determines
   the action.
       
   :arg policy: `encodePolicy.pass` directly copies the (potentially escaped)
                 data, `encodePolicy.unescape` recovers the escaped bytes
                 back.
   
   :returns: :mod:`bytes <Bytes>`
   

.. itermethod:: iter string.items(): string

   
   Iterates over the string character by character.
   
   For example:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
     var str = "abcd";
     for c in str {
       writeln(c);
     }
   
   Output::
   
     a
     b
     c
     d
   

.. itermethod:: iter string.these(): string

   
   Iterates over the string character by character, yielding 1-codepoint
   strings. (A synonym for :iter:`string.items`)
   
   For example:

     var str = "abcd";
     for c in str {
       writeln(c);
     }

   :returns: a new string that is a substring within ``0..<string.size``. If
             the length of `r` is zero, an empty string is returned.
   

.. method:: proc string.isEmpty(): bool

   :returns: the index of the first occurrence of `needle` within a
             string, or -1 if the `needle` is not in the string.
   

.. method:: proc string.rfind(needle: string, region: range(?) = this.byteIndices: range(byteIndex)): byteIndex

   
   :arg needle: the string to search for

   :arg maxsplit: The number of times to split the string, negative values
                  indicate no limit.
   :arg ignoreEmpty: * When `true`  -- Empty strings will not be yielded,
                                       and will not count towards `maxsplit`
                     * When `false` -- Empty strings will be yielded when
                                       `sep` occurs multiple times in a row.
   

.. itermethod:: iter string.split(maxsplit: int = -1)

   :arg maxsplit: The number of times to split the string, negative values
                  indicate no limit.

   Returns a new string, which is the concatenation of all of the strings
   passed in with the receiving string inserted between them.
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
       var x = "|".join("a","10","d");
       writeln(x); // prints: "a|10|d"
   

.. method:: proc string.join(const ref x): string

   
   Same as the varargs version, but with a homogeneous tuple of strings.
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
       var x = "|".join("a","10","d");
       writeln(x); // prints: "a|10|d"
   

.. method:: proc string.join(const ref S: [] string): string

   
   Same as the varargs version, but with all the strings in an array.
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
       var x = "|".join(["a","10","d"]);
       writeln(x); // prints: "a|10|d"
   

.. method:: proc string.strip(chars: string = " \t\r\n", leading = true, trailing = true): string

   
   :arg chars: A string containing each character to remove.
               Defaults to `" \\t\\r\\n"`.
   :arg leading: Indicates if leading occurrences should be removed.
                 Defaults to `true`.

   :returns: A new string with `leading` and/or `trailing` occurrences of
             characters in `chars` removed as appropriate.
   

.. method:: proc string.partition(sep: string): 3*(string)

   
   Splits the string on `sep` into a `3*string` consisting of the section
   before `sep`, `sep`, and the section after `sep`. If `sep` is not found,
   the tuple will contain the whole string, and then two empty strings.
   

.. method:: proc string.dedent(columns = 0, ignoreFirst = true): string

   Remove indentation from each line of string.
   
   This can be useful when applied to multi-line strings that are indented
   in the source code, but should not be indented in the output.
   
   When ``columns == 0``, determine the level of indentation to remove from
   all lines by finding the common leading whitespace across all non-empty
   lines. Empty lines are lines containing only whitespace. Tabs and spaces
   are the only whitespaces that are considered, but are not treated as
   the same characters when determining common whitespace.
   
   When ``columns > 0``, remove ``columns`` leading whitespace characters
   from each line. Tabs are not considered whitespace when ``columns > 0``,
   so only leading spaces are removed.
   
   :arg columns: The number of columns of indentation to remove. Infer
                 common leading whitespace if ``columns == 0``.
   
   :arg ignoreFirst: When ``true``, ignore first line when determining the
                     common leading whitespace, and make no changes to the
                     first line.
   
   :returns: A new `string` with indentation removed.
   
   .. warning::
   
      ``string.dedent`` is not considered stable and is subject to change in
      future Chapel releases.

   uncased (not a letter).
   
    :returns: * `true`  -- if the string contains at least one uppercase
                           character and no lowercase characters, ignoring
                           uncased characters.
              * `false` -- otherwise
   

.. method:: proc string.isLower(): bool

   
   Checks if all the characters in the string are either lowercase (a-z) or
   uncased (not a letter).
   
    :returns: * `true`  -- when there are no uppercase characters in the string.
              * `false` -- otherwise
   

.. method:: proc string.isSpace(): bool

   
   Checks if all the characters in the string are whitespace (' ', '\t',
   '\n', '\v', '\f', '\r').
   
    :returns: * `true`  -- when all the characters are whitespace.
              * `false` -- otherwise
   

.. method:: proc string.isAlpha(): bool

   
   Checks if all the characters in the string are alphabetic (a-zA-Z).
   
    :returns: * `true`  -- when the characters are alphabetic.
              * `false` -- otherwise
   

.. method:: proc string.isDigit(): bool

   
   Checks if all the characters in the string are digits (0-9).
   
    :returns: * `true`  -- when the characters are digits.
              * `false` -- otherwise
   

.. method:: proc string.isAlnum(): bool

   
   Checks if all the characters in the string are alphanumeric (a-zA-Z0-9).
   
    :returns: * `true`  -- when the characters are alphanumeric.
              * `false` -- otherwise
   

.. method:: proc string.isPrintable(): bool

   
   Checks if all the characters in the string are printable.
   
    :returns: * `true`  -- when the characters are printable.
              * `false` -- otherwise
   

.. method:: proc string.isTitle(): bool

   
   Checks if all uppercase characters are preceded by uncased characters,
   and if all lowercase characters are preceded by cased characters.
   
   :returns: * `true`  -- when the condition described above is met.
             * `false` -- otherwise
   

.. method:: proc string.toLower(): string

   
   :returns: A new string with all uppercase characters replaced with their
             lowercase counterpart.
   
   .. note::
     
     The case change operation is not currently performed on characters whose
     cases take different number of bytes to represent in Unicode mapping.
   

.. method:: proc string.toUpper(): string

   
   :returns: A new string with all lowercase characters replaced with their
             uppercase counterpart.
   
   .. note::
     
     The case change operation is not currently performed on characters whose
     cases take different number of bytes to represent in Unicode mapping.
   

.. method:: proc string.toTitle(): string

   
   :returns: A new string with all cased characters following an uncased
             character converted to uppercase, and all cased characters
             following another cased character converted to lowercase.
   
   .. note::
   
     The case change operation is not currently performed on characters whose
     cases take different number of bytes to represent in Unicode mapping.
   

.. function:: proc =(ref lhs: string, rhs: string)

   
   Copies the string `rhs` into the string `lhs`.
   

.. function:: proc =(ref lhs: string, rhs_c: c_string)

   
   Copies the c_string `rhs_c` into the string `lhs`.
   
   Halts if `lhs` is a remote string.
   

.. function:: proc +(s0: string, s1: string)

   
   :returns: A new string which is the result of concatenating `s0` and `s1`
   

.. function:: proc *(s: string, n: integral)

   
   :returns: A new string which is the result of repeating `s` `n` times.
             If `n` is less than or equal to 0, an empty string is returned.
   
   For example:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
      writeln("Hello! " * 3);
   
   Results in::
   
     Hello! Hello! Hello!
   

.. function:: proc +=(ref lhs: string, const ref rhs: string): void

   
   Appends the string `rhs` to the string `lhs`.
   

.. function:: proc codepointToString(i: int(32))

   
   :returns: A string storing the complete multibyte character sequence
             that corresponds to the codepoint value `i`.
